I applied my knowledge of coding with R to a final project of a class called BAE 555. 
I used the data from a survey we distributed around North Carolina, in three different field days. 
Participants had to visually estimate soybean defoliation looking at images of defoliated soybean trifoliates. 
The goal of this research is to investigate the accuracy of humans to estimate defoliation and how their experiences influence their accuracy.
For instance, we expect ag extension agents to estimate defoliation more accurately compared to people that had never been to a soybean field.
